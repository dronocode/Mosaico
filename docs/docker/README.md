Docker Images Building documentation.

Check the [conventions](conventions.md) document for image standard.

Also there is a `sbt-mosaico` support plugin for builds.

Currently it is actually 3 subplugins:

- [`MosaicoDockerPlugin`](docker.md) with support for building (alpine) docker images
- [`MosaicoAmmonitePlugin`](ammonite.md) with support for Ammonite scripts
- [`MosaicoGeneratorPlugin`](generator.md) with support for generate an index of the subprojects.
